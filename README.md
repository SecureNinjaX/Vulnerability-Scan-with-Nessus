# Vulnerability Scan with Nessus

## Project Overview

We will use Nessus Essentials to perform vulnerability assessments on a virtual Windows 10 machine inside of VMware Workstation. We’ll be running a regular scan, a credentialed scan, and then testing the vulnerability of an old version of Google Chrome. By the end of this project, we’ll have a better understanding of how to use Nessus Essentials to identify vulnerabilities and maintain a secure network.

## What You’ll Need

- VMware Workstation
- Windows 10 ISO file
- Nessus Essentials (through a web browser)

## Tasks

This project is divided into four tasks. Each task has its own detailed README file:

1. [Task 1](./Task1/README.md)
2. [Task 2](./Task2/README.md)
3. [Task 3](./Task3/README.md)
4. [Task 4](./Task4/README.md)

## Getting Started

1. Install VMware Workstation and create a new virtual machine using the Windows 10 ISO file.
2. Download and install Nessus Essentials from the official website.
3. Follow the task-specific instructions to perform different types of vulnerability assessments.
# Task 1: Regular Scan of the Windows 10 VM

## Instructions

1. **Network Configuration:**
   - Turn on your Windows VM within VMware Workstation and ensure it is on a "bridged network" to communicate with your host machine.
   - Test connectivity by pinging your Windows VM from your host terminal. If unsuccessful, disable the Windows Defender Firewall on both Private and Public networks.

2. **Launching Nessus:**
   - Access Nessus Essentials through your host machine's browser at [https://localhost:8834/](https://localhost:8834/).

3. **Creating a New Scan:**
   - Click on "New Scan."
   - Choose "Basic Network Scan" as the scan type.

4. **Specify Scan Target:**
   - Enter the IP address of the Windows 10 VM.
   - Provide a name for the scan (e.g., "Regular Scan") and click "Save."

5. **Starting the Scan:**
   - Review the scan settings and click "Launch" to initiate the scan.

6. **Monitoring Progress:**
   - Monitor the scan progress in real-time within Nessus. It will display the number and severity of vulnerabilities detected.

7. **Viewing Results:**
   - Once the scan completes, click on the scan name to view detailed results.
   - The report will include a list of vulnerabilities detected, their severity levels, and recommendations for remediation.

## Regular Scan Results

The results of the regular scan will be displayed in Nessus, detailing identified vulnerabilities and providing actionable insights to improve network security.
# Task 2: Credentialed Scan of the Windows 10 VM

## Instructions

1. **Configuring the Windows VM:**
   - Enable Remote Registry:
     - Click on the Start icon, type “services.msc,” and press Enter.
     - Locate “Remote Registry,” double-click it, set "Startup type" to "Automatic," apply the changes, and click OK.
   - Enable File and Printer Sharing through "Advanced sharing settings."
   - Set User Account Control (UAC) to "Never notify."
   - Edit Registry:
     - Open Registry Editor and navigate to: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System`
     - Right-click, choose "New" > "DWORD (32-bit) Value," name it "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy," and set its value to "1."
   - Restart the VM after making these changes.

2. **Launching Nessus and Creating a New Scan:**
   - Access Nessus Essentials through your host machine's browser.
   - Create a new scan with the same target IP address of the Windows 10 VM.
   - Name the scan "Credentialed Scan."

3. **Configuring Credentials:**
   - Under the "Credentials" tab in Nessus, select "Windows" and enter the username and password for the Windows VM.

4. **Launching the Scan:**
   - Review the settings and click "Save."
   - Click "Launch" to start the scan. Note that this scan will take longer than a regular scan.

5. **Viewing Results:**
   - After the scan completes, click on the scan name to view detailed results.
   - Compare the results with the regular scan to see the additional vulnerabilities identified due to access to system files and applications.

## Credentialed Scan Results

The credentialed scan yielded 87 vulnerabilities (critical, high, medium) compared to the regular scan’s 1 vulnerability, showcasing the increased effectiveness of accessing system resources during the scan.
# Task 3: Re-run Credentialed Scan after Installing an Old Version of Google Chrome

## Instructions

1. **Downloading and Installing Old Version of Google Chrome:**
   - Download an older version of Google Chrome from a safe source.
   - Install the older version on your Windows 10 VM.

2. **Launching Nessus and Rerunning the Credentialed Scan:**
   - Access Nessus Essentials through your host machine's browser.
   - Navigate to the previously created Credentialed Scan or create a new one with the same target IP.
   - Click on "Launch" to start the scan.

3. **Analyzing Scan Results:**
   - After the scan completes, analyze the results to identify vulnerabilities related to the older version of Google Chrome.
   - Note the increase in critical and high vulnerabilities compared to the previous scan.

## Scan Results

The scan results will highlight the increased vulnerabilities associated with the outdated version of Google Chrome, demonstrating the heightened risk posed by using older software versions.
# Task 4: Remediate Vulnerabilities and Run Another Scan

## Instructions

1. **Updating Google Chrome and Windows:**
   - Update Google Chrome to the latest version on your Windows 10 VM.
   - Perform Windows Update to ensure all operating system vulnerabilities are patched.

2. **Relaunching Credentialed Scan in Nessus:**
   - Open Nessus Essentials through your host machine's browser.
   - Navigate to the previous Credentialed Scan used in Task 3 or create a new one with the same target IP.
   - Click on "Launch" to start the scan.

3. **Analyzing Scan Results:**
   - After the scan completes, analyze the results to observe the impact of updates.
   - Note the reduction in critical and high vulnerabilities compared to the previous scan.
   - Verify that vulnerabilities related to the older version of Google Chrome are no longer present.
   - Notice improvements in overall system security due to software updates.

## Scan Results

- The scan results will show that updating Google Chrome and performing Windows Update has significantly reduced vulnerabilities.
- Critical and high vulnerabilities have been minimized to only one, highlighting the importance of timely software updates for security.
# Lessons Learned from This Project

In this project, we learned how to use Nessus Essentials to perform vulnerability assessments. We performed both regular and credentialed scans, and then we saw live how updating software can remove a lot of vulnerabilities.

Through these exercises, we gained the following skills and lessons:
- Understanding the importance of vulnerability assessments in maintaining a secure network.
- Familiarity with Nessus Essentials and its capabilities in identifying vulnerabilities.
- Knowledge of how to configure and run both regular and credentialed scans.
- Understanding the vulnerability of older software versions and the importance of keeping software up-to-date.
- The ability to interpret and act on the scan results to improve the security of the system.
