# Vulnerability Scan with Nessus

## Project Overview

I will use Nessus Essentials to perform vulnerability assessments on a virtual Windows 10 machine inside of VMware Workstation. We’ll be running a regular scan, a credentialed scan, and then testing the vulnerability of an old version of Google Chrome. By the end of this project, we’ll have a better understanding of how to use Nessus Essentials to identify vulnerabilities and maintain a secure network.

## What You’ll Need

- VMware Workstation
- Windows 10 ISO file
- Nessus Essentials (through a web browser)

# Lessons Learned from This Project

In this project, we learned how to use Nessus Essentials to perform vulnerability assessments. We performed both regular and credentialed scans, and then we saw live how updating software can remove a lot of vulnerabilities.

Through these exercises, we gained the following skills and lessons:
- Understanding the importance of vulnerability assessments in maintaining a secure network.
- Familiarity with Nessus Essentials and its capabilities in identifying vulnerabilities.
- Knowledge of how to configure and run both regular and credentialed scans.
- Understanding the vulnerability of older software versions and the importance of keeping software up-to-date.
- The ability to interpret and act on the scan results to improve the security of the system.
